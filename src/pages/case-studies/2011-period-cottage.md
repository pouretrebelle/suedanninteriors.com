The interior of this pretty period cottage was very gloomy and claustrophobic. The sitting room led through to a dark kitchen which led through to a utility room. The elevated stepped garden could not be seen from the house. The master bedroom had fussy flowered wallpaper and views only of the neighbours.

The bathrooms were badly designed with little or no storage.

The brief was to create a bright family home with views to the garden.

Planning permission was obtained to build an extension to the kitchen in place of a conservatory to create a space to move the present utility. The kitchen was then opened up to the rear into a new garden room which leads to a new excavated patio area through large patio doors. The large patio entertainng area was excavated and has integral outdoor fire and BBQ aeras.The rest of the garden was landscaped to provide lawns, planting and further dining areas.

A new Bath Stone fireplace was designed and installed in the sitting room and the working fire now form a focal point in the sitting room. Bespoke fitted cupboards and bookcases were installed, hiding the TV and audio equipment.

The bespoke kitchen and utility area make a spacious family room and are now filled with light with views to the garden

The master bathroom was made into a spacious shower room with plenty of storage and an en-suite was created for the master bedroom.

All three bedrooms had bespoke wardrobes installed for maximum storage.

It is now a spacious light family house.
