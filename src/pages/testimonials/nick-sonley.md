Sue Dann has worked with us on several projects, which involved designing fairly complex public areas in our Hotels. We have found her to be very enthusiastic, and her work has been inspiring. We have also found her to be able to work within budgetary confines, a rare ability in the designer world! Her touch of style and class is very evident in her schemes.

Sue always has a professional and commercial approach to any project, and her ability to source specific items is a great asset. She has a wealth of knowledge, and her design experience is very apparent. She takes real personal interest in her projects, and we heartily recommend her to any potential client.
