They were based in Chambery.</p>\n<p>The window for any construction or building works in the Ski Resorts is very small – 1 st May to 31 st\nNovember so we had to work very quickly to produce all the designs before we could secure\ncontracts with the builders.</p>\n<p>Both of the apartments were stripped back to the concrete shells and all the new interior walls,\nwiring, plumbing and cladding were added.</p>\n<p>We created 3 bedrooms with ensuites and a Jack and Jill Steam Room with shower to be used by the\n4th bedroom.</p>\n<p>Most interior walls were clad with Larch and some plastered, some stone feature walls were also\nadded.</p>\n<p>The main sitting room now has a 4 metre high vaulted ceiling with a 3 metre wide drop down\nprojector screen and a stunning full height stone clad fire.</p>\n<p>The kitchen and bathroom carpentry was all made from locally sourced Antiqued Fir and the floors\nall Oiled Oak.</p>\n<p>There are fake fur throws and luxurious rugs everywhere creating a cosy atmosphere.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"January 01, 2018",slug:"2018-alpine-chalet",title:"Duplex Apartment in Val D’Isere, French Alps",cover:"choucas-cover.jpg"}},galleriesJson:{images:[{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_199_1.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_202_1.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_209_1.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_219.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_225.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_229.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_237.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_242.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_251.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_255.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_271.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_278.jpg"},{title:null,path:"416_CHOUCAS_286.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet01.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet02.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet03.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet04.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet05.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet06.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet07.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet08.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet09.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet10.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet10.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet11.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet12.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet13.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet14.jpg"},{title:null,path:"chalet15.jpg"}]}},pathContext:{slug:"2018-alpine-chalet"}}}});
