We have worked on many Hotel, Restaurant and Bar projects from Castles in Wales to Grade II listed buildings in Buckinghamshire.

When working on Contract Projects we consider carefully the requirements of the future clientele as well as respecting the aesthetics of the buildings.

We work with specific manufacturers to ensure all the products used meet the necessary safety regulations for public areas.

We can design and supply everything from the carpets, lighting schemes, furniture and all the soft furnishings.
