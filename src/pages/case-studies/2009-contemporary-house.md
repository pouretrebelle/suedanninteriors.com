The clients in this house had a wonderful collection of modern art and some contemporary furniture including a large L-shaped sofa but the room was cold and needed an injection of colour and texture.

We added clean modern horizontal stripe curtains, sumptuous textured cushions, modern lighting and a very large textured rug to bring the room together.

The bedroom was totally renovated with a bespoke sliding wardrobe and the layers of curtains provided privacy but blocked out the light when needed.

Sumptuous cushions and bedside lights were set against the metallic feature wall.
