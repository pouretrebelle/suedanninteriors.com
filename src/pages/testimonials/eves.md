Dear Sue, just a little note to say a big thank you for all the hard work you put in re-vamping our house. We are really delighted with the final result.

All the colours, soft furnishings and accessories work beautifully. The finished project has exceeded our expectations and our son’s girlfriend commented that our home should be in one of the Home Design Magazines!
