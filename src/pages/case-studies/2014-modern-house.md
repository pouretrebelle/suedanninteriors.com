The owners of this property wanted a contemporary but comfortable feel to this room. Careful planning was needed as space was limited and the room was needed to fulfil various roles.

A large L- shaped bespoke sofa was designed to create a sitting area with facilities for reading and watching TV and we designed a bespoke glass dining table to seat up to 8 people in the narrow dining area.

Bespoke contemporary storage units were designed to house the TV and provide storage in the seating area and a further sleek narrow storage unit in the dining area.

Contemporary wall lights, floor lamp and a table lamp were added to provide controllable atmospheric lighting.

The transparency of the glass dining table and coffee table avoided foreshortening of the room.

The finishing touches were jewelled coloured Artisan Glass pieces complimenting the general cool neutral colour scheme of the room.
