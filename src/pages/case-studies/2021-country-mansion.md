In this country house we initially worked on the impressive entrance hall, stairs, and landing.

To elevate the entrance we designed a bespoke marble flooring pattern with borders and cabochons in a contrasting colour, which we laid over wet underfloor heating for a luxury feel. Our Joiner crafted Georgian-inspired half panelling and bespoke window seats, and we completed the interior with calming lighting and a stunning damask wallpaper up the stairs and landing.

We recently returned to the property to renovate the master suite and guest bedrooms, continuing with a neutral palette to emphasise the abundant natural light throughout the house.
