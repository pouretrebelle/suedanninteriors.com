We can help with every aspect of your Interior Design requirements for the home.

We can help with large or smaller projects including complete renovations and refurbishments.

We can provide you with scale floor plans, elevations, lighting plans, and help you coordinate your works.

If your project is purely decorative we can develop design schemes and provide all the elements required from wall coverings to soft furnishings to flooring and lighting.

We tailor our Design Schemes to suit your tastes and to create a home which is not just attractive to look at but you will also feel comfortable to live in.

We can create stunning Contemporary Interiors as well as Stylish Elegant more Classic Interiors.

Alternatively you may just be looking for that one lamp or rug to finish off your own schemes.

We carry a large range of top fabrics, lighting, rugs and furniture - [see our products page](/products).
