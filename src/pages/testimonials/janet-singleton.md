Dear Sue, just a little note to say a big thank you for all the hard work you put in re-vamping our house. We are really delighted with the final result.

All the colours, soft furnishings and accessories work beautifully. The finished project has exceeded our expectations and our sonâ€™s girlfriend commented that our home should be in one of the Home Design Magazines!
