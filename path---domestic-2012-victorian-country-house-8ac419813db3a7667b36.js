The furniture layout was completely reorganised focusing around the new log burning stove.</p>\n<p>The three bedrooms were completely redecorated with pale neutrals, roman blinds providing privacy with flowing linen voiles softening the windows.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"January 01, 2012",slug:"2012-victorian-country-house",title:"Victorian Country House in Rode, Somerset",cover:"rode12.jpg"}},galleriesJson:{images:[{title:"Dining room",path:"rode03.jpg"},{title:"Sitting room corner view",path:"rode08.jpg"},{title:"Sitting room lamps",path:"rode09.jpg"},{title:"Sitting room sofas",path:"rode08.jpg"},{title:"Sitting room with new sofas and log burning stove",path:"rode11.jpg"},{title:"Sitting room detail",path:"rode13.jpg"},{title:"Guest bedroom 1",path:"rode04.jpg"},{title:"Details of headboard and cushions in guest bedroom 1",path:"rode02.jpg"},{title:"Guest bedroom 2",path:"rode06.jpg"},{title:"Guest bedroom 2 feature wall",path:"rode07.jpg"},{title:"Guest bedroom 3",path:"rode01.jpg"}]}},pathContext:{slug:"2012-victorian-country-house"}}}});
