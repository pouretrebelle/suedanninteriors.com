We are absolutely thrilled with the renovation project Sue Dann has carried out for us. The apartment is totally transformed by Sue’s stylish creativity, sourcing of wonderful interiors and excellent project management.

Sue has been very professional with all the people she has come into contact with, such as clients, suppliers, construction workers, and indeed other apartment owners. Sue has kept us very well informed with progress of the works, costs and made it a trouble-free experience for us.

We could not have achieved this result without Sue Dann and we are delighted with the stunning home we can now enjoy.
