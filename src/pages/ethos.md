Our wide ranging experience across all areas of interior design allows us to provide you with a complete service, from the supply of one pair of curtains to completely re-designing your hotel, house or kitchen.

We can produce professional scale plans and elevations, plus lighting plans and design schemes. We discuss with you, every aspect of your project, big or small.

The first consultation is free of charge and consists of an informal chat to establish your principal requirements.

Following further consultations, we present fully detailed proposals and costings, ensuring you are fully aware of the scope of the project.

Work commences when you are in full agreement with schemes, costs and terms.

All necessary insurances are carried to allow us to work in your home or business. This is a requirement of membership of the British Institute of Interior Design.
