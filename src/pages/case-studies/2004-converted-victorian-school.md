This Victorian School was converted into an impressive seven bedroom family home. We started work on the project before exchange of contracts. The original owner/developer had designed the kitchen but the buyers, our clients, were not happy with the layout so we were asked to redesign the kitchen and carried on to design the whole house.

Some of the original school halls were converted into two floors leaving interesting windows providing a challenge for window dressings.

We designed bespoke furniture for many areas including, a dining table and display cabinets, oak bookcases and plasma TV housing in the family room, and a concave oak storage unit in the sitting room.
