This handsome Victorian Country House had many beautiful original features and the owners had some fine antique furniture and artwork but the rooms were dull and cluttered.

The d√©cor was dated and did not show the house off to its full potential.

The brief was to completely redecorate the main reception rooms and three bedrooms including carpets, window treatments, lighting and some furniture.

We fitted neutral wool textured carpet throughout which gave the whole area a lift and connected the rooms.

The hall stairs and landing were given warm neutral stripe wallpaper above the dado and a darker neutral colour below together with new brass glass lanterns giving the entrance a bright welcoming feel.

We added sumptuous rich silk stripe curtains in the dining room with a masculine feel to match the hunting theme in the artwork and rich mahogany furniture.

The previously dark cluttered sitting room was transformed into a light comfortable summer room with soft shades of green in the silk curtains, pale textured chenille sofas and clean modern lamps. The furniture layout was completely reorganised focusing around the new log burning stove.

The three bedrooms were completely redecorated with pale neutrals, roman blinds providing privacy with flowing linen voiles softening the windows.
